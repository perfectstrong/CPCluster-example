## Motivation

Adobe Captivate supports exporting modules to HTML5 format, included a lot of resources in common, which lead to an excessive amount memory.

That's why I come up an idea of clustering those modules into one _"theater"_ having one projector and multiple catridges loaded should the needs arises.

## Cluster

The structure of cluster will resemble this below:
````
cluster/
|--assets
|--unitLoader.html
|--module
````
